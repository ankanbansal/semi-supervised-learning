	We present an approach for semi-supervised image classification based on clustering and locality
	penalties which encode knowledge about the dataset class distribution and
	object locality in the learning objective. The first clustering penalty (called Mean Entropy
	Loss, MEL) encourages the classifier to be more confident of its predictions, while the second
	(called Negative Batch Entropy Loss, NBEL) prompts the average output distribution to be the
	same as the distribution of classes in the training dataset. The proposed locality penalty is
	based on group sparsity and encodes the idea that objects in images generally occupy small
	regions in the image. We evaluate our approach in the semi-supervised setting on ImageNet and CIFAR-10
	datasets.
