\section{Introduction}

% This is all just placeholder text.
Data is hard to come by. There is a need for computer vision systems which require less data. We
present such a system. We study this. And we study that. We report amazing results. We have the best
results. 

We use a combination of three loss functions - Classification, Clustering, Locality. 

Different levels of supervision. Few-shot learning. Weakly supervised detection/classification.

   (always set in Roman: $B \sin A = A \sin B$) may be included without an
   ugly clash.}
