%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
	We present an approach based on clustering penalties for semi-supervised image classification.
	The proposed penalties can incorporate prior knowledge about the data distribution in the
	learning pipeline. The first penalty (called Mean Entropy Loss (MEL)) encourages the classifier
	to be more confident of the predictions, while the second (called Negative Batch Entropy Loss
	(NBEL)) enforces prior knowledge about the distribution of classes in the training dataset. We
	evaluate our approach in the semi-supervised setting on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 datasets.
